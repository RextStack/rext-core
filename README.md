The core library required to run Rext, the fullstack, batteries included framework.

## What is Rext?

Rext is a fullstack Rust framework in active development, aimed at providing a batteries included experience for building fullstack web applications.

This crate serves as the core of Rext that provides all the mandatory functionality and is extensible so additional rext modules can be added to rext projects as needed.

## How to get started?

The Rext TUI is the tool to get started with Rext, find it [here](https://github.com/RextStack/rext-tui)

> **Note**
> There are two changelogs, CHANGELOG.md, which is manually currated, and CLIFF_CHANGELOG.md, which is generated by `git-cliff`. The CLIFF log is used as a quick overview of anything we might have missed in the manually currated changelog when creating a new release. It can be ignored, unless you are helping create a release.

# Installation

run `cargo add rext-core` or add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
rext-core = "0.1.0"
```

> **Warning**
> This project is in early development. The API is unstable and subject to change. Not recommended for production use or demos. Only install if you are looking to contribute and test.

# Current Progress

- Working on the app scaffolding. This is setting up the initial directories and files, making sure dependencies are installed, everything compiles, and migrations are able to run.

- Current steps are: init project with TUI, run migrations, then generate entities with TUI, then cargo check/run. This is obviously not ergonomic at all, after the files are scaffolded, we'll automate these next two steps. Waiting till the project actually compiles though.
**Note:** Right now, things almost compile, but the generated sea-orm-cli models are coming out different compared to the example project. This is a bit odd.

- After this, will need to migrate the modules that are technically rext-core lib modules into rext-core and import them into the scaffolded app. Right now, for simplicity, we're just trying to scaffold the app that was created in [Example rext app](https://github.com/LostRhapsody/example_rext_project). Once that can be built, compiled, and runs perfectly out-of-the-box with no config, we'll work on moving it's modules into rext-core so they don't fill up a user's code base.
**Note:** Still on the fence as to what a blank-slate Rext app should look like. Either a hello world, empty canvas with a bunch of modules and libs installed behind the scenes, or a blank canvas that can be made much larger by including pre-built modules for Auth and things, but not as behind-the-scenes library, instead as code-gen, so the code is generated and placed in your project, and after that you're responsible for it and can expand/remove it as needed. Not sure. One is ideal for learning, the other for library maintenance and upgrading.

- After the module migrations are done, we'll add some example files to the scaffold, i.e. "hello world"
